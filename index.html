        <h1>My Love,</h1>
        <p>Waking up to this made my heart so full. Every word you wrote, every emotion you poured into this, I felt it deeply. I don’t even know how to put into words how much you mean to me, but if love had a language, I think you just spoke it perfectly.</p>
        <p class="small-text">No matter where we are, my heart always finds its way to you.</p>
        
        <p>You say you’re grateful for me, but I’m the lucky one. To be loved this way, so purely and unconditionally—it’s everything I could ever ask for. And if I ever had any doubts about being enough, you wash them all away with your love.</p>
        <p class="small-text">You are more than enough, just as you are.</p>
        
        <p>Every day with you is a blessing. You bring light into my life in ways I never thought possible. Even on my hardest days, knowing you’re by my side makes everything okay. Distance may separate us at times, but my heart is always with you. Each moment apart only makes me cherish the moments we share even more.</p>
        <p class="small-text">Even when we’re apart, I feel you with me.</p>
        
        <p>I love you, more than I can ever express. Every day, every moment, with every breath. You are my person, too—my heart, my peace, my forever. No matter where life takes us, you will always be my home. I find comfort in your presence, strength in your love, and endless joy in knowing that we are in this together.</p>
        <p class="small-text">You are my safe place, my love, my always.</p>
        
        <p>I promise to always stand beside you, to cherish you, to support you in your dreams, and to remind you every single day just how loved you truly are. You are the best thing that ever happened to me, and I am grateful for you in ways words cannot describe.</p>
        <p class="small-text">Loving you is the easiest thing I’ve ever done.</p>
        
        <p>Thank you for loving me the way you do. For being patient, understanding, and for making me feel like the luckiest person alive.</p>
        <p class="small-text">You and I, forever and always.</p>
        
        <p class="signature">Forever yours.</p>

        <div class="card-container">
            <div class="card">You make my heart skip a beat every time I see you.</div>
            <div class="card">Every little moment with you means the world to me.</div>
            <div class="card">I love how just one look from you can turn my whole day around.</div>
            <div class="card">I dream of the day when I won’t have to say goodbye at the end of the day.</div>
            <div class="card">If I could, I’d steal you away for a private moment right now.</div>
